Description: This R package provides methods for transporting causal estimands from a multi-source data to a target population. The multi-source data can be a collection of trails, observation cohorts, or a combination of both, which have same datat structure (outcome, treatment, and covariates). The target population can be one internal source-specific data, or an external dataset where only covariate information is available. The causal estimands available for transportation is average treatment effects and subgroup treatment effects.
